## Docker custom Bridge Network

=> docker network create my-bridge-network
=> docker network inspect <network-name> \
=> docker network ls

- first create the network 
=> docker network create my-bridge-network

- create the first container 
=> docker run -d --name my-nginx --network my-bridge-network nginx

- create the second container over the same network
=> docker run -it --name=c1 --network=my-bridge-network ubuntu bash

=> apt update 
=> apt install -y curl 
=> curl http://my-nginx or curl my-nginx , both will work

## connect any container to multiple Docker networks using docker network connect, and similarly disconnect them later using docker network disconnect
=> docker network create net-one
=> docker network create net-two

=> docker run -d --name my-nginx --network net-one nginx

- Now my-nginx is part of both net-one and net-two using below
=> docker network connect net-two my-nginx 

=> docker network connect my-bridge-network my-nginx
=> docker network connect my-bridge-network c1
=> docker network disconnect my-bridge-network my-nginx
=> docker network disconnet my-bridge-network c1

## remove / delete 
=> docker network rm my-bridge-network
