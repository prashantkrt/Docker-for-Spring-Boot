## docker system prune: ## To Clean Up activity within docker

This command removes unused data, including:
- stopped containers
- unused networks
- dangling images (images not associated with any container)
- build cache

-a / --all:
This tells Docker to also remove unused images, not just dangling ones. So it deletes:
any image not currently used by a running or stopped container

-f / --force:
This skips the confirmation prompt and runs the prune immediately.
