Run a new container using the ubuntu image.
Execute the date command inside that container.
Print the result (current date and time based on the container's clock).
Exit immediately after the command finishes.

1. docker run ubuntu date :=> This is the Linux command passed as an argument to the container. It shows the current system date and time.
2. docker run ubuntu ls 

-i = Interactive
-t = terminal-like interface inside the container.

Starts a container from the Ubuntu image
Opens an interactive shell (bash) inside it
Lets you type commands and interact as if you're inside a normal Linux machine
By default, the ubuntu image uses /bin/bash as its CMD, so it usually drops you into a shell.

3. docker run -it ubuntu :=> Allocate a terminal (-t) and keep STDIN open (-i) so you can interact with it.
