## Detatched Mode
# In docker detached mode allows you to run a container in the background, rather than keeping it attached to your terminal session.

=>  -d or --detach flag with docker run

# docker run -d --name my-nginx -p 8085:80 nginx, use http://localhost:8085
# docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx, use http://localhost:8080
- The container starts in the background.
- Docker returns the container ID immediately.
- Your terminal is freed up for other commands.

- The container keeps running until it is stopped manually so to run in the background and freed up the terminal we have to user -d or -detach
  else the container will keep running until you stop it manually.
